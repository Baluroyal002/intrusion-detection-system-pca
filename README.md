# Intrusion Detection System using PCA with Machine Learning Classifiers

## Overview
This project implements a **Network Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction and various **Machine Learning classifiers** for detecting malicious network activities. The aim is to improve the efficiency and accuracy of intrusion detection by reducing feature complexity while maintaining strong classification performance.

## Key Features
- **PCA-based feature reduction** to handle high-dimensional data.
- Multiple **ML classifiers** (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, KNN).
- **Training and testing on benchmark intrusion datasets**.
- **Performance comparison** of classifiers based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualizations and reports** for analysis.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Dataset:** NSL-KDD / CICIDS or any chosen dataset
